# About Me

I am a computer vision researcher, but I also work on (deep) machine learning, vision robotic, and medical imaging. I earned a BE in Computer Engineering at Tribhuvan University , under the direction of [Sanjeev Prasad Panday](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oTWWLT8AAAAJ&hl=en). If you are interested in discussing research, feel free to reach out via Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn. You can also send me an email: my address is just the url of this site with the '.github.io' replaced by '@wustl.edu'.

I have a few different roles:

* Sr.Software Engineer,BP Eye Foundation(Ongoing)
* Machine Learning Engineer , Machine Learning Engineer(Feb 2020 – Feb 2022)
* Computer Vision Engineer(R and D),National Innovation Center  (Jan 2021 – Sep 2021)
* Software Engineer, Omnibluetech(Aug 2018 — Feb 2019)

# Research

I am excited about using computer vision and machine learning techniques to understand the world. I have focused on a variety of problems, including image classification,Object Localization,Object detection,Image segmentation,Object identification,Action Classification,Pose Estimation,OCR,2D code reading,Object tracking,Optical Flow,Egomotion,Reconstruction,Streo Vision, medical imaging, and video surveillance. You can learn more by visiting my [Github](https://github.com/MadanBaduwal), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJhPtjZJHtSvYgviEBJImA), or checking out my [CV](https://madanbaduwal.github.io/CV/).
