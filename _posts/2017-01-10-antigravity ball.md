AstroidSmash is a 2D game. The inspiration behind the game is sir Issac Netwon after coined gravity. What happens if there is no gravity? This game is based on this concept.

The player is a ball that is not affected by gravity. Our target is to pull the ball downward. We can pull the boll downward by tapping on the screen.

Different obstacles appear in a way. We need to maintain gravity so that we didn't collide with an obstacle.
